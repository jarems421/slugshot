# Lobby hub in Roblox

The final hub designs built for the game, on top of the approved block-out, whose simple colliders still carry the player. Everything here is look-only. Status: **Implemented, in owner review, 2026-11-01.** Not published. Runtime performance on a real phone is **Unresolved**.

## How it's built

- **Place:** `python tools/lobby/build_hub.py` writes `build/SlugshotLobbyHub.rbxlx` from `lobby-hub.private.project.json`. `--check` adds a short camera check.
- **Models:** `python tools/lobby/hub_mesh.py all <key>` samples each piece from the asset library's own shader, builds a budgeted game mesh in Blender (`blender_hub_piece.py`), and paints every texel from the shader. `python tools/lobby/hub_mesh.py list` shows budgets.
- **Uploads:** `python tools/lobby/upload_hub_assets.py`, private, into ignored `private-assets/lobby`.
- **Place scripts:** `experiments/lobby/hub`. `HubArt.server` places the art and effects and hides the block-out it replaces. `HubMotion.client` runs all motion and the Detail button.

## Decisions from owner review (Confirmed, 2026-11-01)

- Bridges rest still and only move when someone is on them. This replaces the earlier "slight sway at all times".
- Crack mushrooms are really tiny, about 1 to 2 studs. The concept's `tiny = 2` setting holds this.
- Cracks have real depth and glow. No puffs of mist come out of them.
- Waterfalls must read as flowing liquid in the whirlpool's colours, with a visible connection where they land. They are now scrolling sheets with ripples and foam, not a mesh.
- The gate symbol toward the gun side is the game's blaster: two prongs, a canister, a rear disc.
- A Detail button in the place switches between High and Low. A game can't change Roblox's own graphics level.

## Roblox versions differ from the concept on purpose

| Concept | Game |
| --- | --- |
| Volumetric storm | Stacked discs of the concept's cloud field, turning at slightly different rates |
| Volumetric light | Soft camera-facing Beams |
| Folded juice surface | A smooth funnel that rotates, with folds in its colour and normal maps |
| Falls | Scrolling Beams with wavering edges, ripples and foam at the foot |
| Light rising from cracks | Emission and bloom only, with the painted halo |

## Costs

Measured in Studio on an RTX 3070, before the last two rounds: about 145k to 195k triangles and 80 to 125 draw calls in most views, with the Low setting taking off about 10%. All pieces together are about 270k before Roblox's automatic LOD. Those numbers aren't phone evidence. The last two rounds weren't measured, because Play didn't start from the automated check.
