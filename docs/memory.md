# Project memory

## 2026-10-28 ? Foundation setup

- Inspected an empty workspace and read the pasted request and PDF background. Kept the request authoritative; PDF gameplay instructions were not adopted.
- Reused existing Rokit 1.2.0 and cached Rojo 7.7.1, StyLua 2.6.0, Selene 0.32.0 and Luau LSP 1.70.1. No tool, addon or third-party skill was installed.
- Created minimal source probes, isolated Studio test project, verification tooling, editor configuration and CI. Normal build contains exactly three scripts; no gameplay or authored environment.
- Created shared agent instructions, three original mirrored procedure skills, Markdown knowledge system, asset/creature/ADR templates and specialist research.
- Verified local formatting, linting, shared-module types, both Rojo builds, sourcemap, built script placement/source fidelity, test isolation, skill metadata/parity and local HTTP serve. The API uses MessagePack in this Rojo version; connectivity verification checks HTTP status/content without claiming a Studio sync.
- Kept integration examples inactive and documented approval-dependent steps. No global client configuration, account connection, GitHub remote or publishing action was changed.
- Deferred Studio runtime/multiplayer/MCP tests because no approved active session/connection was available. The bundled skill validator lacks PyYAML; no dependency was installed to work around it.
- Initialized local Git and created the foundation snapshot on `main`. See [verification](verification.md), [status](status.md) and [research](research/tooling.md).

## 2026-10-28 - GitHub publication

- User requested GitHub publication with a simple README, then explicitly selected public visibility.
- Reused the authenticated GitHub CLI to create https://github.com/jarems421/slugshot and configure `origin`.
- Simplified the README to a project description, setup commands and links. Updated current notes to reflect the approved remote.
- First hosted Linux CI passed: https://github.com/jarems421/slugshot/actions/runs/40719697932. Local foundation checks also passed previously. Studio/MCP setup remains separate.

## 2026-10-28 - Approved Studio integrations verified

- The owner approved the matching Rojo plugin, Studio MCP for Claude Code/Codex, runtime/two-client verification and pushing results.
- Installed the plugin bundled with Rojo 7.7.1. Studio auto-updated to 0.745.0.7451137 during launch; its built-in MCP setting was already enabled and was verified live.
- Claude's private project-local entry reports Connected. Codex's project config is active; native app-server discovered 31 tools and made live list/read calls without a model turn. Only this workspace's trust was added.
- Single-client and separate server/two-client tests passed. Each client logged once, saw both players, loaded the shared module and could not see the server bootstrap. EndTest returned success and the parent returned to Edit mode.
- Verified filesystem-to-Studio sync with a temporary source comment, then restored and verified exact original source. The normal place has no test folder.
- Captured sanitized evidence in [the Studio record](evidence/2026-10-28-studio.json). Documented avatar asset-type and built-in MaterialManager warnings without changing design/assets. Host config, tokens, raw logs and scratch helpers remain untracked.
- No requested integration/runtime test remains pending. No gameplay or unrelated plugin was added. See [verification](verification.md) and [reproduction](testing.md).
